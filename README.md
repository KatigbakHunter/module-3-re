Overview: One of the datasets included in this repository is election data. It includes Ballot id, county, and canidate. For the second dataset, it contains date and profit/losses of the company for that month.

For the election dataset. I created a python script that returns the total votes casted. A list of canidates with thier total votes casted for them and the percentage of of votes for them. It also has the canidate winner. For the budget data set, I created a python script that detials the total months that the data was collected from. The net profit of the company, the average loss of money over the entire dataset. It also details the highest increases in profits and greatest decrease. Resources I used to help me write code are INstructor Drew's speed runs and recorded class sessions. I also used Official Python Docs as a reference to write the code. My pyBank script is located inside the folder pybank, inside pybank there is a folder name analysis which contains my PyBank script.
